# HyperTab

A brutally simple browser extension that targets Firefox meant to be a replica of Chrome's tab switcher. Quickly open, search, then switch to any open tab.

## Usage

Open tab search with <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> (it would be <kbd>A</kbd>, but Firefox uses this for add-on management). Search is automatically focused so you should be able to type some fuzzy search and immediately narrow down what you're looking for.

## Why?

Switching from Chrome to Firefox is mostly fine. But Firefox's current "story" for navigating between tabs is really sub-par (IMO). This extension, for me, implements a _must have_ feature for any browser I am using: Quick tab search and switch.

## Privacy/Security

You're probably here to make sure this extension isn't doing anything sneak, right? Good for you, everyone who is able to understand code should do this. Have a look around and see for yourself. **But,** I will save you a bunch of time: this browser extension does not persist anything and does not talk to any servers; it doesn't need to!
